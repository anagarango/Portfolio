With Rooty, you can post a listing of something you’d like to help someone with and browse until you find something suitable for you. Simply send a message through the app to get started. Since freelancing and tutoring are done primarily online, this app is focused for now on BCIT students, including features that allow them to meet in person, network with students from different faculties, practice and calmly freelance without the pressure of being perfect, and be able to showcase what your freelancing skills were used for in the other student’s projects and add it to your resume.",

        p3:"Created the navigation bar, carousel with cards, buttons and toggles, inputs, uploading image input, on-click interaction, textareas, number counter on the “Create Post” page, the blog posts for the “Insights & Tips” section for the users to use on the app on the “Home” page. We focused on making it mobile-friendly first, and after, I took over making the web app responsive to desktop. I also created the app’s registration process and used Next.js, Framer-Motion, Material-UI Components, React Semantic-UI, and Style-Components (CSS).",
        p4:"I collaborated with backend developers to implement features and components to match the design our designers created and met up at least twice a week. We worked together efficiently as we understood how each person worked individually and used our strengths in harmony to create a web app we’re proud to share. I checked in with my group mates about my progress and updates and spoke about what deadlines I should set for my tasks to make sure we could finish on time without stressing out about the final presentation we made presenting this web app early December 2022.",
