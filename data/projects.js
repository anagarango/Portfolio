With Rooty, you can post a listing of something you’d like to help someone with and browse until you find something suitable for you. Simply send a message through the app to get started. Since freelancing and tutoring are done primarily online, this app is focused for now on BCIT students, including features that allow them to meet in person, network with students from different faculties, practice and calmly freelance without the pressure of being perfect, and be able to showcase what your freelancing skills were used for in the other student’s projects and add it to your resume.",

We focused on making it mobile-friendly first, and after, I took over making the web app responsive to desktop. I also created the app’s registration process and used Next.js, Framer-Motion, Material-UI Components, React Semantic-UI, and Style-Components (CSS).",
        p4:"I collaborated with backend developers to implement features and components to match the design our designers created and met up at least twice a week. We worked together efficiently as we understood how each person worked individually and used our strengths in harmony to create a web app we’re proud to share. I checked in with my group mates about my progress and updates and spoke about what deadlines I should set for my tasks to make sure we could finish on time without stressing out about the final presentation we made presenting this web app early December 2022.",

With HTML and CSS – Styled-components to create all components for each page, I had to debug my front-end code so that it stays responsive on different devices and make sure my code was easy to read and maintain with consistent naming conventions and reusing components to remove clutter. Other programs I used to complete this project are Figma and Adobe Package, specifically Illustrator and Photoshop.",

Because of that, a lot of Google Searching took place to make this project work. It took a month to make this project, so I made constant efforts throughout that month to add or make something work so the process was nice and easy. This project helped me improve my problem solving skills and how reading documentation of the technologies is absolutely IMPORTANT. Especially when the technology is well-known among many developers, the more effort to make the docs clear makes it better, so that taught me that I should read documentation always when before, I thought it was boring or not necessary to read.",
